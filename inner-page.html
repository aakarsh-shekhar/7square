<p>12.2. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN NO CASE SHALL THE LIABILITY OF 7square OR ANY OF THE RELATED PARTIES EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).Because some provinces or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of 7square and the Related Parties shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>13. Indemnification. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold 7square and the Related Parties harmless from any and all claims, demands, damages or other losses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from or arising out of (i) your use of the Site or (ii) your breach of this ToU or any other policies that 7square may issue for the Site from time to time.</p>

<p>14. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This ToU is governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of laws principles. You and 7square agree that, except as otherwise provided in Section 15 below, the state and federal courts located in San Antonio, Texas will have exclusive jurisdiction of all disputes arising out of or related to this ToU or your use of the Site and agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 7square shall be allowed to apply for equitable remedies (including injunctions) in any jurisdiction.</p>

<p>15. Binding Arbitration.</p>

<p>15.1. Arbitration Procedures. You and 7square agree that, except as provided in Section 15.4 below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this ToU (each a “Claim“), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules“) and under the terms set forth in this ToU. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 15 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 15 will control and prevail.Except as otherwise set forth in Section 15.4, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and 7square will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this ToU, (a) you and 7square may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (b) the arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND 7square WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p>
<p>15.2. Location. The arbitration will take place in San Antonio, Texas, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances.</p>
<p>15.3. Limitations. You and 7square agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between 7square and you individually. YOU AND 7square AGREE THAT (a) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (b) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (c) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.</p>
<p>15.4. Exceptions to Arbitration. You and 7square agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or 7square’s intellectual property rights; (b) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use of 7square’s intellectual property; and (c) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>
<p>15.5. Arbitration Fees. If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will need to pay the JAMS arbitration initiation fee. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules.</p>
<p>15.6. Severability. You and 7square agree that if any portion of this Section 15 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 15.4), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 15.4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor 7square will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 15.4 found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within San Antonio, Texas, and you and 7square agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
<p>16. General.</p>

<p>16.1. ToU Revisions. This ToU may only be revised in a writing signed by 7square, or published by 7square on the Site.</p>
<p>16.2. No Partnership. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and 7square as a result of this ToU or your use of the Site.</p>
<p>16.3. Assignment. 7square may assign its rights under this ToU to any person or entity without your consent. The rights granted to you under this ToU may not be assigned without 7square’s prior written consent, and any attempted unauthorized assignment by you shall be null and void.</p>
<p>16.4. Severability. If any part of this ToU is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then that portion shall be severed, and the remainder of the ToU shall be given full force and effect.</p>
<p>16.5. Attorneys’ Fees. In the event any litigation or arbitration is brought by either party in connection with this ToU, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.</p>
<p>16.6. No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any provision of this ToU shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect 7square’s right to enforce the same provision at a later time. An express waiver by 7square of any provision, condition or requirement of this ToU shall not be understood as a waiver of your obligation to comply with the same provision, condition or requirement at a later time.</p>
<p>16.7. Notices. All notices given by you or required under this ToU shall be in writing and addressed to: 7square Investments Inc., 2635 Rue Lippe H4R 1L9 Montreal, QC, Canada.</p>
<p>16.8. Export Administration. You must comply with all export laws and regulations of the Canada or any other country (“Export Controls“) and you shall not export, direct or transfer any portion of the Site, or any direct product thereof, to any destination, person or entity restricted or prohibited by the Export Controls.</p>
<p>16.9. Equitable Remedies. You acknowledge and agree that 7square would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this ToU were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we shall be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this ToU, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.</p>
<p>16.10. Entire Agreement. This ToU, including the documents referenced in this ToU, constitutes the entire agreement between you and 7square with respect to the Site and supersedes any and all prior agreements between you and 7square relating to the Site<p>
